-
- Please send feedback from you as a server owner, whether you like this kind of configuration or not and why you do or do not.
-
- There's a cooldown for the chat that can prevent chat spam.
- The configuration for this is written in sentences.
-
- There's a couple of rules associated with this:
- You can only modify everything in between curly brackets {}
- {is}, {will} can be replaced by {is not}, {will not} to disable/invert that feature.
- Floating point numbers are allowed if it was already a floating point number by default like {1.0}, {6.0} and {8.0}
- Make sure you're not making any mistakes in this like adding a trailing space, because that will break it.
-
- I recommend testing the chat beforehand by typing 'acrashscreen_debug' in chat.
